/** Fluent, synchronous HTTP client based on Apache Http Components.
 *
 * To obtain a Http object, just use the constructor new Http();
 *
 * To start building a request, use the factory methods
 * {@link #newGet(String url)},
 * {@link #newPost(String url)},
 * {@link #newPut(String url)},
 * {@link #newDelete(String url)} or
 * {@link #newRequest(String method, String url)}
 *
 * To execute the request (synchronous) and get the response, use
 * {@link ClientRequest#execute()}
 *
 * This is a synchronous HTTP library.  That means that the client
 * thread will be blocked when executing the request until the response
 * is being obtained. If you need an async or non-blocking HTTP library,
 * go look elsewhere.
 *
 * The 2 motivations for writing this fluent API on top of Apache HTTP
 * commons are:
 * 1) ClientRequest and ClientResponse classes are serializable
 *    with Gson.
 * 2) Allow access to the response status line as well as the
 *    response body.
