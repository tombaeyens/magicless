/** Base test class for testing a HTTP server.
 *
 * There are convenience methods to build and execute HTTP requests:
 * {@link #newGet(String)}, {@link #newPost(String)}, {@link #newPut(String)},
 * {@link #newDelete(String)}, etc.
 * HTTP requests are executed synchronous, which is convenient for testing
 * and debugging purposes.
 *
 * The cool feature is that server side exceptions are captured and added
 * as the cause to the client side exceptions when asserting the http
 * response status with {@link ClientResponse#assertStatusOk()} etc.
 *
 * Usage see example/src/test/java/be/tombaeyens/magicless/ExampleTest.java */
