# Purpose

A framework for building Java executable jars that expose a HTTP or message based service.
  
# Design goals

* Plain Java instead of annotation magic. Read docs and step through code instead of Googling stackoverflow for use cases.
* Good naming so the API becomes simple, predictable and codecompletable
* Great support and guidance for tests     
* Good exception messages, also in tests
* Minimal dependencies
